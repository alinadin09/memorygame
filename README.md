# Memory Game Project

This project was completed as part of the 2nd project requirement for the front-end web deverloper nanodegree. The game involves flipping 2 cards at a time to see if the icons match. If they do, they stay open, otherwise they close again. When all 16 cards have been matched, the player wins the game. Once he wins, he is told how long it took him and what his star rating was. The star rating is determined by the following:

* Completing the game in 16 moves or less is 3 stars;
* 18-34 moves is 2 stars; 
* 35 moves or more is 1 star.

I created this project according to the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view) given by Udacity.

## Contributing

There were a great many resources I used to complete this project! Mike Wales' video helped me get started in creating logic for [matching the cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&reload=9&v=_rUH-sEs68Y&app=desktop).

The [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp)'s section on modals was also helpful.

I also looked at code from two of my fellow classmates [Deb](https://github.com/DebBugging/Memory-Game--Udacity-FEND/blob/master/css/app.css) and [Matt](https://github.com/mattdahlseid/national-parks-memory-game/blob/master/css/styles.css) to see how they set up their timer and rating logic. I also looked at [Sammich](https://codepen.io/YOURsammich/pen/RyeOoz)'s code to see how I could modify my CSS for proper responsiveness.
